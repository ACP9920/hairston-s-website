    <h2 class="section-title">The Hairston Legacy</h2>
    <div class="legacy-content">
      <div class="legacy-text">
        <h3>Where It All Began</h3>
        <p>In 1947, William "Bill" Hairston Sr. started Hairston Construction with nothing but a toolbox, a strong work ethic, and a dream to build something lasting. Working out of his garage in South St. Louis, Bill specialized in post-war home repairs and small renovations, earning a reputation for honest work and fair pricing.</p>
        
        <h3>Building the Foundation</h3>
        <p>By the 1960s, Bill's son, Robert Hairston, joined the business fresh out of high school. Robert brought innovation and expansion, introducing the company to larger commercial projects while maintaining the personal touch that made Hairston Construction a household name in St. Louis neighborhoods.</p>
        
        <h3>Modern Growth</h3>
        <p>In 1985, Michael Hairston took the helm, steering the company through economic challenges and technological advances. Under Michael's leadership, Hairstons became one of the first local contractors to embrace computer-aided design and modern building techniques while preserving traditional craftsmanship values.</p>
        
        <h3>Today's Leadership</h3>
        <p>Now led by fourth-generation owner David Hairston, our company continues to evolve while honoring our roots. David brings a fresh perspective, environmental consciousness, and a commitment to sustainable building practices, ensuring Hairstons remains at the forefront of the industry.</p>
        
        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p>As we look ahead, David's daughter Sarah is already learning the trade, representing the fifth generation of Hairstons ready to carry forward our legacy of excellence, integrity, and family values in home remodeling.</p>
